This is a quick Terminal.app profile (color scheme) for OS X based on the [base16 Ocean theme](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean). I couldn't find one in the official repo, so I hastily made my own. 

A little about base16:

> Base16 provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set of sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications.

If you like this theme, be sure to check out the [editor color schemes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-textmate) and [Spacegray UI theme](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) for Atom and Sublime Text.

## Usage

1. Download this repo.
2. Open up Terminal, go to **Preferences**, then **Profiles**.
3. In the bottom left, click the settings cog and select **Import...**. Navigate to the download file and open it.
4. Lastly, set it as your default by selecting the new profile and clicking the **Default** button.
